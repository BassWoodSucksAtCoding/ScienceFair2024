                        Imagine a coin dropped from the top of the Empire State Building, accelerating as it falls through the air. With each second, it picks up speed, reaching a point where it could potentially become a dangerous projectile. The sheer height and the powerful force of gravity create an intriguing scenario: could something as small as a coin, under such conditions, pose a serious threat? The story behind this urban legend is as captivating as it is mysterious. To uncover the truth and explore the science behind this fascinating myth, click the image next to the text.

            <p class="popup-text">
                <p>When construction of the Empire State Building in New York City ended in 1931, a popular legend emerged. If a visitor to the top floor, 381 m above the ground, dropped a coin, it would reach the speed of a bullet before hitting the ground &#8722; which could kill an unfortunate pedestrian. But simple physics comes to the rescue of New Yorkers.</p>

                <p>A coin is flat and circular, and the shape means that air resistance will quickly equal gravity. When it does, the coin cannot fall any faster, and after only 15 m, the coin will reach its top speed of about 40 km/h. At this speed, the coin will still hurt and maybe even injure if it hits, but it&rsquo;s unlikely to kill. Also, this speed is difficult to calculate and depends on the weather and the coin&rsquo;s rotation as it falls through the air. According to some estimates, a coin would be able to reach a speed of 100 km/h, but still be harmless.</p>
                
                <p>Bullets are shot off at a speed of more than 1,000 km/h. Several people have tested the myth in practice. One of them is physicist Louis Bloomfield from the University of Virginia, who sent coins up and down wind tunnels with helium balloons to model the fall from a skyscraper and subsequently had the coins hit his forehead. The impact was felt, but he says it didn&rsquo;t even hurt.</p>
                
                <p>The Discovery Channel MythBusters TV series tested the myth in 2003. Coins were shot off at a speed of more than 100 km/h, and it was concluded that a falling coin can probably only cause harm, if it hits you in the eye. However, nails and pens should not be thrown from tall buildings, as they can cut through the air like arrows. While air molecules are constantly hitting a coin on its way down, they will glance off a pointed, thin object. A pen can reach a speed of more than 300 km/h, and when it strikes, it deposits its energy in a very small point &#8722; small enough to pierce a skull.</p>
